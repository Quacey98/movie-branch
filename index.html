    <h2> Spirited Away</h2>
    <p class="spirit">Spirited Away (千と千尋の神隠し , Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, literally translated as "Sen and
      Chihiro's Spiriting
      Away"), is the 12th animated film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, and
      premiered in theaters in Japan on July 20, 2001.<br>
      The story is about the adventures of a young ten-year-old girl named Chihiro as she wanders into the world of the
      gods and spirits. She is forced to work at a bathhouse following her parents being turned into pigs by the evil
      witch Yubaba.</p>
    <p class="spirit">The film was made to please the ten-year-old daughter of Hayao Miyazaki's personal friend, director Seiji Okuda.
      Okuda's daughter even became the model for the film's protagonist, Chihiro. During the film's planning phase,
      Miyazaki gathered the daughters of Ghibli's staff in a mountain hut in Shinano Province to hold a training
      seminar. His experience led him to wanting to make a film for them, since he had never made a movie for girls at
      the age of 10.</p>
